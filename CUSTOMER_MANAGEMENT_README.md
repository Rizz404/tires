# Customer Management Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a customer management screen following the patterns from `home_screen.dart` and `my_reservations_screen.dart`. The implementation uses mock data based on the User entity and provides a comprehensive table view of customers.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Widgets Created:
1. **`customer_table_widget.dart`** - Main table component displaying customer data
2. **`customer_stats_card.dart`** - Statistics dashboard showing customer metrics

### Modified:
- **`admin_list_customer_management_screen.dart`** - Updated to use mock data and new widgets

## Features Implemented

### Customer Table Columns:
1. **Customer** - Avatar with initials + Full Name + Full Name Kana
2. **Contact Info** - Email + Phone Number
3. **Status** - Registered/Guest + First Time/Repeat
4. **Reservations** - Count of reservations with label
5. **Last Reservation** - Relative date + formatted date
6. **Actions** - View details icon (with navigation placeholder)

### Statistics Dashboard:
- Total Customers count
- Registered vs Guest breakdown
- First Time customers count
- Visual indicators with color coding

### States Handled:
- ✅ Loading state with progress indicators
- ✅ Empty state with proper messaging
- ✅ Error state with retry functionality
- ✅ Infinite scroll with load more
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh functionality

### Debug Tools:
- Refresh data functionality
- Clear data option
- Load more testing
- State inspection
- Console logging

## Mock Data Logic

### User Classification:
- **Registered**: Users with company/department info
- **Guest**: Users without company/department info
- **First Time**: Users with 0 reservations (ID % 5 == 0)
- **Repeat**: Users with 1+ reservations

### Reservation Count Logic:
```dart
if (id % 5 == 0) return 0; // First time (20%)
if (id % 3 == 0) return (id % 10) + 1; // Variable count
return (id % 7) + 1; // Default range
```

### Last Reservation Date:
- Based on user ID to create varied dates
- Ranges from 1-30 days ago
- Null for first-time customers

## Usage Pattern

The implementation follows the established patterns:
1. **State Management**: Local state with setState (no provider needed yet)
2. **Scrolling**: CustomScrollView with Slivers
3. **Loading**: Separate loading states for initial vs more data
4. **Debug Tools**: Integrated DebugSection for development
5. **Theming**: Consistent with AppTheme and extensions
6. **Error Handling**: Proper error states with retry options

## External Package Recommendations

For enhanced table functionality, consider adding:
```yaml
dependencies:
  data_table_2: ^2.5.9  # Enhanced DataTable with fixed columns
  # or
  pluto_grid: ^7.0.2    # Advanced grid with filtering/sorting
```

## Next Steps

1. **Replace Mock Data**: Integrate with actual customer API
2. **Add Navigation**: Implement customer detail screen navigation
3. **Add Filtering**: Search by name, email, phone
4. **Add Sorting**: Sort by columns (name, date, reservations)
5. **Add Bulk Actions**: Multi-select for bulk operations
6. **Add Export**: CSV/Excel export functionality

## Technical Notes

- Uses User entity from `/features/user/domain/entities/user.dart`
- Implements responsive table layout
- Includes proper accessibility labels
- Handles overflow text with ellipsis
- Uses Material 3 theming consistently
- Supports both light and dark themes via theme extensions
